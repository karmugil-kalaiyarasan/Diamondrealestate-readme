### Live Link:

* Here is the live hostinger link for the website: [https://diamondgroupofrealestate.com/](https://diamondgroupofrealestate.com/)
* Since it is a realworld live project I cannot share the website code without the client's acknowledgement.

### Project Details:

##### Phase one:

* I have created a simple real world React frontend website for one my client who wants a website to be created for the Real estate business within 2 days and hosted it on Hostinger.
* The design for the first phase is a simple website with black and white theme as per the clients requirement.
* This whole project is has three phases to it.
* The first phase is to create a simple website which is fully responsive for the user for every available mobiles, tabs and laptops.
* User can submit a web form so the client gets an email and they contact the customer back based on the user email, phone number provided by the user through the web form.
* We used emailjs a react npm package to send emails.
* The webpage is broke down into multiple small components and added to the pages based on the things to be shown on the pages.
* Integrated google maps and call the client which can be accessed just by a single click to the buttons.
* In the similar fashion the user can read google review and write new reviews to google with a single click.
* There is also a slider created using "react-slick" and "slick-carousel" which lists the user reviews.

##### Phase two:

* On phase two which I am currently working on I am creating a CMS(Content Management System) as the backend of the website.
* My CMS That I choose for this project is Drupal and the backend language si nodejs and express.
* Here we are designing the CMS in such a way that the website will have a user login system along with a Access control layer.
* The admin users can edit options to edit the website where as the normal user will only be able to use the website will not have admin access.
* And the website will have a page where the properties available will be listed and a page where the user can see the details of a single particular property.
* One more page which will be used to get the quote for that single property that the user wants to know.
* Also the website will have sort by option to sort all the property, filter option to filter the available property and search the available property.

### Phase three:
* The Third phase is to add more animations and design to the website once the CMS and all the pages are completed.
* On this phase the website will have an extensive design enhancements like animations, muted videos on the background, more responsive and many more to make the website look more modern.
